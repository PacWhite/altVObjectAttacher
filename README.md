# alt:V Object Attacher
(original written by [Squizzor](https://github.com/Squizzor))

This is a "fork" of Squizzor's Object Attacher. It got a major makeover and the necessary bug fixes to make it run smoothly under alt:V Dev15.

Later on, I'll be adding more default animations and a few code examples.
